# Examples with SystemC 

Example code to be used as **reference** when dealing with SystemC. 
These are *laboratory exercise* I've done relatively to the *Modeling and Optimization of Embedded System* course at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. 

## What it's modeled
These are different possible implementation, at different abstraction levels, of a Traffic Light System that have two traffic lights, a sensor for a car approaching the secondary street and a timer responsible for the color change.

## Current Issues
* The makefile(s) are relative to the environment I've worked with at University, and I didn't have a look at them yet. They should be personalized to be used on other machines. 
* Some files are divided in .h and .c files, it would be better to join them.
* The last example, with the BUS, compiles correctly but is not working. The problem seems related to the timer implementation. I will take a look at it as soon as I'll have the time.
